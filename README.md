CS609 Reinforcement Learning Project: Race Strategy Optimisation

Given the following race conditions, the project objective is to optimise timing and number of  pit stops:
- Number of laps: 162
- Race Track: circular
- Race Track Radius: 600m to 1200m
- Weather: Each weather type will result in varying maximum speeds and rates of degradation of the tyres
  1. Dry (eg. sunny day)
  2. 20% Wet (eg. drizzle which just started)
  3. 40% Wet
  4. 60% Wet
  5. 80% Wet
  6. 100% Wet (eg. heavy rain)
- Tyre Choices: Each tyre will have a different rate of degradation
  1. Ultrasoft
  2. Soft
  3. Intermediate
  4. Fullwet
