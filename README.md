CS609 Reinforcement Learning Project: Race Strategy Optimisation

Given the following race conditions, the project objective is to optimise timing and number of  pit stops:
- Number of laps: 162
- Race Track: circular
- Race Track Radius: 600m to 1200m
- Weather: Each weather type will result in varying maximum speeds and rates of degradation of the tyres
  1. Dry (eg. sunny day)
  2. 20% Wet (eg. drizzle which just started)
  3. 40% Wet
  4. 60% Wet
  5. 80% Wet
  6. 100% Wet (eg. heavy rain)
- Tyre Choices: Each tyre will have a different rate of degradation
  1. Ultrasoft
  2. Soft
  3. Intermediate
  4. Fullwet

Project Implementation:
- DQN
- Monte Carlo Tree Search
- Rules based

Project Evaluation Data Set:
- Our test set is a range of various weather sequences, approximately 90 different weather sequences, all beginning with an intermediate tyre choice.

- Notable behaviour
  - (-11,093) Rules-based will act immediately after valid weather changes
  - (-11,102) DQN shows heavy oscillation but is similar to rules-based behaviour. 
  - (-11,087) MCTS behaviour erratic but seems to react appropriately to weather changes

- Notable behaviour
  - (-16,007) Rules-based will act immediately after valid weather changes.
  - (-16,009) DQN shows heavy oscillation but is like rules-based behaviour. 
  - (-16,014) MCTS behaviour erratic but seems to react appropriately to weather changes

- Notable behaviour
  - (-18,694) Rules-based responds to 60% Wet weather condition.
  - (-18,770) DQN shows heavy oscillation in tyres, which is hard to interpret. 
  - (-18,588) MCTS takes a different tyre trajectory compared to rules-based, using all 4 tyre types. The difference in results is also much larger here.
